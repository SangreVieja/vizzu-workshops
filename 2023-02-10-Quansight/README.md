## Welcome to the repo folder of the ipyvizzu tutorial for Quansight developers. 
## It's great to have you here :blush:

Feel free to clone the contents of this repo, so you can see all the code that was on the screen and make adjustments and experiment with the charts being shown during or after the talk. We'd love to see what you do with the examples we built.

You can find all the example and playground notebooks in the notebooks folder, the data in the data folder and some HTML outputs in the html folder.
