## Hello there!
### Welcome to the repository folder for the Vizzu & PyData: Open Source Contributions Meetup #1
## We're thrilled to have you here with us! :blush:

In this readme and the repo, you'll find a collection of useful resources related to the workshop, such as the ipyvizzu notebooks that I presented during the session, along with some additional ones that I've prepared for you to experiment and learn more about this powerful tool and its presentation extension: ipyvizzu-story.

Moreover, you'll find some helpful links to some Streamlit apps that show how our tools work within that platform and the ipyvizzu documentation.

### Preparations
Register on Github, create a fork, and clone the ipyvizzu and ipyvizzu-story repositories. Here’s some info on how to get started: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects
If you don’t have a local environment to run Python or Jupyter, we suggest you to install Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
It’s an extra if you have Python3 and Git client installed and know how to create a Python virtual environment. More info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
