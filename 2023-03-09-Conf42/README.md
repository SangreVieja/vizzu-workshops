## Hello there!
### Welcome to the repository folder for Conf42 talk: Let them explore! Building interactive, animated reports in Streamlit with ipyvizzu & a few lines of Python. 
## We're thrilled to have you here with us! :blush:

If you've watched the video, I'd like to ask you for a small favor. Can you please spare 2-3 minutes of your time and fill out this survey? Your valuable feedback will help me and the entire Vizzu team to better understand your needs and thoughts on what we do. Here's the link to the survey: https://forms.gle/UjDtpW7X9SKCdkWs8

In this readme and the repo, you'll find a collection of useful resources related to the talk, such as the ipyvizzu notebooks that I presented during the session, along with some additional ones that I've prepared for you to experiment and learn more about this powerful tool and its presentation extension: ipyvizzu-story.

Moreover, you'll find some helpful links to the Streamlit app and its source code, the ipyvizzu documentation, as well as to the bidirectional component that integrates ipyvizzu into Streamlit.
