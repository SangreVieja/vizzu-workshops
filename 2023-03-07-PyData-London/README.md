## Hello there!
### Welcome to the repository folder for the PyData London Meetup talk about ipyvizzu
## We're thrilled to have you here with us! :blush:

If you  watched the talk, I'd like to ask you for a small favor. Can you please spare 2-3 minutes of your time and fill out this survey? Your valuable feedback will help me and the entire Vizzu team to better understand your needs and thoughts on what we do. Here's the link to the survey: https://bit.ly/vizzu-survey 

In this readme and the repo, you'll find a collection of useful resources related to the talk, such as the ipyvizzu notebooks that I presented during the session, along with some additional ones that I've prepared for you to experiment and learn more about this powerful tool and its presentation extension: ipyvizzu-story.

Moreover, you'll find some helpful links to some Streamlit apps that show how our tools work within that platform and the ipyvizzu documentation.
